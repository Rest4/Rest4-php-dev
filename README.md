# Rest4 developement configuration file

This is my development environnement. By adding this folder in the include_path of 
each Rest4 instances in your development server, you can define global values to
each instances in the conf/conf.dat file given in this repository.

This file contains two important parts :
- a conf/conf.dat file that erase some configurations to facilitate debug
- a index.php file you can copy in your project directory to set some debug consts

This repository comes as it is in my own server. Feel free to change it an to pull 
your own usage !
